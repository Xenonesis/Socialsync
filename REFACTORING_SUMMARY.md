# Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Brand Name Changes
- **Updated**: Changed all instances of "Social Sync" to "Social Sync" throughout the codebase
- **Package Name**: Changed "lovable-tagger" to "social-sync-tagger" to match project branding
- **Files Updated**: package.json, index.html, manifest.json, robots.txt, all component files

### 2. Component Refactoring
**Team.tsx** was refactored into smaller, focused components:

#### New Components Created:
- **TeamHero.tsx** - Handles the hero section with animated title and description
- **TeamGrid.tsx** - Manages team member display with cards and animations
- **ContactForm.tsx** - Handles contact form functionality and validation
- **ServicesInfo.tsx** - Displays service information cards with animations

#### Benefits:
- **Improved Maintainability**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Better Reusability**: Components can be reused across different pages
- **Easier Testing**: Smaller components are easier to unit test
- **Cleaner Code**: Reduced complexity in the main Team component

### 3. File Cleanup
**Deleted Unused Files:**
- `ENHANCEMENTS.md` - Temporary documentation file
- `src/App.css` - Unused CSS file
- `public/placeholder.svg` - Unused placeholder image
- `bun.lockb` - Unused lock file
- `src/components/examples/` - Empty directory
- `src/components/ui/flip-words-demo.tsx` - Demo component
- `src/components/ui/card-spotlight-demo.tsx` - Demo component
- `src/components/ui/footer.tsx` - Replaced with inline implementation
- `src/components/ui/calendar.tsx` - Unused component
- `src/components/ui/chart.tsx` - Unused component
- `src/components/ui/carousel.tsx` - Unused component

### 4. Code Optimization
- **Removed Unused Imports**: Cleaned up import statements across components
- **Simplified Footer**: Replaced complex UIFooter with inline implementation
- **Bundle Size Reduction**: Removed unused dependencies and components

### 5. Build Optimization
- **Successful Build**: All refactoring completed without breaking functionality
- **Bundle Analysis**: 
  - CSS: 74.42 KB (12.28 KB gzipped)
  - JavaScript: Split into optimized chunks
  - Total: ~545 KB with efficient code splitting
